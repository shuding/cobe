# API

The library exports a default function `createGlobe`, which accepts two required parameters and returns a globe instance. Here’re the definitions:

```ts
import createGlobe from 'cobe'

const globe = createGlobe(canvas, options)
```

## `canvas`

A [HTML canvas element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) with `width` and `height` defined.

## `options`

An object with the following properties:

| Property | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|
| devicePixelRatio | The “[DPR](https://developer.fastly.com/reference/io/dpr)”, defaults to 1 |  |
| width | The width of the canvas | Required |
| height | The height of the canvas | Required |
| phi | The [φ angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system), 0 ≤ phi ≤ 2π | Required |
| theta | The [θ angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system), -π ≤ theta ≤ π | Required |
| dark | Display the globe in dark or light mode, 0 ≤ dark ≤ 1 | Required |
| diffuse | Control the [diffuse lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics_lighting#:~:text=of%20lighting%20interactions.-,Diffuse,the%20angle%20of%20incoming%20light.), 0 ≤ diffuse | Required |
| mapSamples | Number of dots displayed, 0 ≤ mapSamples ≤ 100000 | Required |
| mapBrightness | Brightness of the dots, 0 ≤ mapBrightness | Required |
| mapBaseBrightness | Brightness of samples that are not on the map, 0 ≤ mapBaseBrightness | |
| baseColor | [r, g, b] of the base color, 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 1 | |
| markerColor | [r, g, b] of the markers’ color, 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 1 | |
| glowColor | [r, g, b] of the glow color, 0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 1 | |
| scale | Scales the globe, 0 ≤ scale |  |
| offset | [offsetX, offsetY], offset of the globe in pixel |  |
| markers | An array of markers displayed | |
| maxMarkers | Control the max amount of markers on the globe (0-300), defaults to 64 | |
| opacity | The transparency of the globe texture | |
| onRender | A callback function called when a new frame is rendered | Required |

You can check how some of them actually look like in the [Playground](https://cobe-playground.vercel.app).

### `markers`

A marker is an object of `location` and `size` properties. `location` is a pair of _latitude_ and _longitude_:

```js
markers: [
  { location: [37.7595, -122.4367], size: 0.03 },
  { location: [40.7128, -74.006], size: 0.1 },
  ...
]
```

For example San Francisco is at [37.7595, -122.4367](https://www.latlong.net/c/?lat=37.774929&long=-122.419418).

### `onRender`

A callback function that will be called on every re-render, you can re-assign some options to the `state` object to update them:

```js
let currentPhi = 0

const globe = createGlobe(canvas, {
  ...
  onRender: (state) => {
    // Called on every animation frame.
    // `state` will be an empty object, return updated options.
    state.phi = currentPhi

    // Rotate the globe by 0.01 on every frame.
    currentPhi += 0.01
  },
})
```

## `globe`

A [Phenomenon](https://github.com/vaneenige/phenomenon) instance. It has methods like `globe.toggle()` to pause/resume rendering, and `globe.destroy()` to destroy itself. Please read its docs for more details.
